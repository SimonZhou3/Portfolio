I'm a 4th year student at the University of British Columbia studying in Computer Science. I love food, lifting, and video games. 
Most importantly, I enjoy the thrills and challenges that come from Software Development.

My primary expertise include front-end web development and data visualization. As of now, I'm learning into concepts such as Cloud Computing and 
Distributed Systems â€“ just trying to have some fun learning along the way!

I'm always trying to learn and improve myself by creating works that can help contribute to society.
